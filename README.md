Small, fun coding projects to help me cut my teeth with Python.

## encrypt
Extremely basic encryption thing that takes two strings - a key and a message - and encrypts. Can also decrypt and generate a random key. Uses random for key generation, which is apparently bad form, but I really hope no one of importance is using my silly encryption code for something that crucial. Could be improved by keeping all letters as plain old Latin letters. May revisit idea in future while looking at say, Enigma?
